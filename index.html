Dear Mind,

I know when you’re presented a challenge you always rise to the occasion.<br>
I know you’re taking responsibility for solving the mystery of my life’s equation,<br>
But we hardly agree and it results in many of our fights.<br>
They’re the reason for all my countless, sleepless nights.<br>

It’s nine p.m. and I’m lying restless in my bed.<br>
If you don’t remember this is when you take my hand and replay all the nightmares in my head.<br>
So if you don’t mind I’d like to recap on our conversations,<br>
And though this may seem rude this time I’ll be using no abbreviations.<br>

You always remind me of my mistakes,<br> 
And although it’s not my fault the first is always my face.<br>
You don’t understand how grateful I am for being unable to see,<br>
Because my glasses are the one thing that makes my face truly unique.<br>

I already know I see my father in my own reflection,<br>
And I don’t appreciate the thoughts of being nothing more than his duplication.<br>
Don’t you understand that I know I was the first star on my father’s skin?<br>
And don’t you think it’s  punishment enough that I’m abolished by his kin.<br> 

You try to convince me that I’m a terrible brother,<br>
But I know you’re wrong because I do more for my sisters than their own fathers.<br>
Sometimes I’m not always there to tuck them in bed or to make sure they’ve been fed,<br> 
And to my sisters I apologize for all these storms brewing in your brother’s head.<br> 

It’s twelve a.m. and my baby sister’s sleep has been interrupted.<br>
As my mind, I thought you would understand my will, but these tears stopped me in fear as if I have been abducted.<br> 
She’s only four years old and she has a heart greater than the sky,<br>
And it pains me even further because her mid-night lullaby are the sounds of my crys.<br>

You always try to denounce me as a son,<br>
But I fear for my mother and care for her more than anyone.<br>
We both know she works herself sick,<br>
Because she sleeps during the day and works at night as if she’s a lunatic.<br>

We all know it’s hard to have four kids and be a single parent,<br>
And my mother is a trooper because her love is stronger than a river’s current.<br> 
If I see this in my mom does that make me a decent son?<br>
Mind, I wish upon a star for our disconnection, so I can finally have the chance to run.<br> 

You never really let me fall in love,<br>
Because you exaggerate our separation as if one was confined to the Earth, and the other has been sealed in the sky above.<br>
You tell me I’m not enough, but you never opened your ears to her words.<br> 
It annoys me because you let her messages fly away like migrating birds.<br>

You know all the incredible things we’ve done for one girl.<br>
So why, at the end of each night, do you allow for all our love to swirl?<br>
Please mind, I’m begging you change your ways because if you don’t you’ll conclude your love story,<br> 
And trust me without her you’d be nothing so please continue the construction of your chemistry laboratory.<br>

It’s five a.m. now and it’s time to get ready for school by starting with a shower.<br> 
It’s time to start preparing to prove all your intellectual power.<br> 
Maybe today is the day I finally prove that I’m not worthless to you.<br> 
Maybe today will be the end of all my nightmare reviews.<br>

Dear Mind,<br> 

I know when you’re presented a challenge you always rise to the occasion.<br>
I know you’re taking responsibility for solving the mystery of my life’s equation,<br>
But please do us both a favor and end all these mental fights.<br>
I promise all our pain and misery will slowly fade away if you just let me sleep tonight.<br>  
</h1>
